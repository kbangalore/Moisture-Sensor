<p class="auto-style2"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My Project:&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">My project was to create a moisture sensor for plants, this will help measure the moisture level of the soil and hence be able to save the amount of water that you will need to keep the plant alive and grow healthy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style2">It has been found that a moisture level of 30% is enough to keep a plant alive and healthy, In my project, I will create a system that will check the moisture level of a potted plant and inform the user when the moisture level is below 30. It is a signal for the user to water the plant and hence keep the plant healthy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="auto-style2"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Items used in this design:</span></em></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. </span>Arduino board</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>2. Moisture Sensor</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>3. Wires to connect the board, sensor etc.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>4. LED Light</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">As noted above, most plants are not able to live with a moisture level lower than 30% and when the happens, I have used the sensor will fire sending a signal to an LED telling it to light up. When the light is turned on, the plant has to be watered.</p>

<p class="auto-style2">Why is this helpful?</p>
<p class="auto-style2">This product helps lower your water usage. Everyday many people waste water by watering their plants when it is not needed. By using this product you will be saving around 3% water of your total water consumption per day per plant, if you have many plants at home - these savings would be bigger.</p>
